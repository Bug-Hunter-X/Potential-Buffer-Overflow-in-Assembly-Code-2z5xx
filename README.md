# Potential Buffer Overflow in Assembly Code

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short snippet of x86 assembly code. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking on an array access.

## Vulnerability Description

The assembly instruction `mov eax, [ebx + ecx * 4]` accesses a memory location calculated from the values in registers `ebx` and `ecx`.  If `ecx` is not properly validated, it could lead to accessing memory outside of the allocated array, causing a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.

## Mitigation

The solution involves adding a check to ensure that `ecx` remains within the valid bounds of the array before performing the memory access.
