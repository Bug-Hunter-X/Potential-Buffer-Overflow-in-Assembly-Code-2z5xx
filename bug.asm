mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx * 4`.  The bug arises if `ecx` is unexpectedly large.  If `ecx` is large enough, the calculation `ebx + ecx * 4` could result in an address outside the allowed memory space, leading to a segmentation fault or access violation.
